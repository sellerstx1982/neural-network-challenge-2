# Neural Network Challenge Predicting Attrition and Department Suitability for Employees
My coding project uses pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, and tensorflow in Jupyter Notebook to access company data from a Uniform Resource Locator, or URL, that downloads a CSV file.

## Process
To begin, open the attrition.ipynb file in a source code editor that supports Jupyter Notebook files. I recommend using Google Colab if TensorFlow is not installed in your source code editor. Each cell has Python code within it. Use the play button outside the top left corner of each cell to run each cell. You can also click inside the cell and press Shift + Enter to run the cell and move down to the next cell. The output of each cell displays what the comments request from the code using the Python coding language and supporting libraries listed above.
